## Architecture

### **Multi-Tenant Architecture**

```markdown
[User] ─→ Login ─→ [Select Workspace]
                    ├─ Workspace A
                    ├─ Workspace B
                    └─ Workspace C
                    
Each workspace has:
- Independent users and permissions
- Isolated business data
- Custom roles with specific permissions
- Separate financial records
```

### **Authentication Flow**

```markdown
[1. JWT Authentication]  →  [2. Business Selection]  →  [3. Permission Loading & Caching]
User logs in              User selects workspace      Permissions fetched from DB
JWT token issued          X-Business-Id header        Cached per business
                          added to requests           Reused until business changes
```

### **Payroll flow**

```markdown
[1. Collect Data]
- Attendance records    (calculate worked days/hours)
- Leave requests        (deduct unpaid leaves)
- Business user salary  (get base salary)

[2. Calculate Payroll]
- Base salary
- + Allowances          (meal, transport, housing)
- + Bonuses             (performance, holiday)
- - Deductions          (tax, insurance, late/absent)
- = Net salary

[3. Approve Payroll]
- HR reviews
- Manager approves

[4. Pay Salary]
- Status → PAID

[Period Statuses]
      ↓
   DRAFT  ←──────────────── can edit records, add bonuses/deductions
      ↓
 PROCESSING ←────────────── submitted for manager review
      ↓
  APPROVED ←─────────────── manager approved, ready to pay
      ↓
    PAID ←──────────────── salaries transferred to employees
      
  CANCELLED ←────────────── can cancel from DRAFT or PROCESSING only
```

## API Usage

### Authentication

```bash
POST /auth/login
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "password123"
}

Response: { "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs..." }

```

## Database Schema Highlights

- **users**: Core user authentication and profile data
- **businesses**: Workspace/organization records
- **business_user**: Maps users to businesses with roles
- **roles**: Permission sets with fine-grained access control
- **permissions**: Individual permission definitions (e.g., `attendance.view`)
- **contacts**: CRM contact database
- **campaigns**: Marketing campaign management
- **attendances**: Employee attendance records
- **leave_requests**: Leave request and approval workflow
- **payrolls**: Salary calculations and payment records

## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Permissions follow the naming convention: `resource.action`

Examples:

- `attendance.view`, `attendance.create`, `attendance.edit`, `attendance.delete`
- `customer.view`, `customer.create`, `customer.edit`
- `payroll.view`, `payroll.approve`, `payroll.process`
- `leave.approve`, `leave.request`

Each role can have multiple permissions assigned, and users inherit permissions based on their role in a business.

<!-- Cách tính lương theo tháng

- Lương tháng = [(Lương cơ bản + Phụ cấp (nếu có)) / 26 (hoặc 22 nếu nghỉ t7 & cn)] × Số ngày làm việc thực tế + Thưởng – Phạt – Thuế TNCN (nếu có)

- Lương trong tháng 31 ngày = (Mức lương cơ bản + Phụ cấp (nếu có) / 27 (hoặc 23 nếu nghỉ t7 & cn)) x Số ngày làm việc thực tế + Thưởng – Phạt – Thuế TNCN (nếu có)

- Lương tháng 13 = (Số tháng làm việc trong năm / 12) x Tiền lương trung bình

- Bảo hiểm: dựa trên lương gốc hoặc mức cơ bản -->
